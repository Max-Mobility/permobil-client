Once you have done that, restart the PushTracker app and the PushTracker should be able to reliably connect - without needing to re-pair to the phone!",

For someone who is just learning to push or to use a SmartDrive, we recommend setting both very low.",

With the SmartDrive you are still able to push around in your chair as you normally would - you can now go farther faster and with less effort!
